# Wrapt
Wrapt is an extension built on Spotify's User Data API.
Wrapt aims to inform users of their listening activity (top artists and tracks) over varying time periods
<br> 
* Short (1 month)
* Medium (~ 3 months)
* Long (~ 1 year)

With Wrapt, the possibilities of sharing your music taste are endless. We have integrated an Instagram Story feature, which allows users to share their top 5 artists and songs as an IG Story.

We have even enabled a unique newsletter feature, which shares your top artists and tracks of each month via email.
